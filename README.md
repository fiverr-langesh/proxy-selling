By default the server will run on port 8000. If you want to change the port, you can do it in the file server/.env

If you have changed the port don't forgot to change the API_URL in the file client/.env

Update the `MONGO_URI` in the file server/.env with your mongoDB URI

```bash
cd server
```

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm start
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 to see the app.
